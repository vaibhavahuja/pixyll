Heyy!
I am __Vaibhav Ahuja__, a third year Electrical Engineering undergrad at Delhi Technological University (_formerly Delhi College of Engineering!!_). I am interested in Mathematics (_it makes me think a lot_), Machine Learning and Data Analysis. I also like Web Development and Designing. I also like to solve algorithmic problems, and read about new stuff.

I enjoy playing Chess, Cricket, Football(_my favourite sport_), and Running. I have finished two Half Marathons (_21.1 kms_), which is something I am really proud of. I like to read about Mythological Stuff, and Philosophy. Huge CR7 fan.
