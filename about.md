Heyy!
I am __Vaibhav Ahuja__, a third year Electrical Engineering undergrad at Delhi Technological University (_formerly Delhi College of Engineering!!_). I am interested in Mathematics (_it makes me think a lot_), Machine Learning and Data Analysis (_again numbers!_). I like to solve Algorithmic Problems and Web Development & Designing is something that interests me too.

I enjoy playing Chess<small>([_always up for a game_](https://www.chess.com/member/ahujavaibhav))</small>, Cricket, Football<small>(_my favourite sport_)</small>, and Running. I have finished two Half Marathons <small>(_21.1 kms each :P_ )</small>, which is something I am really proud of. I like to read about Mythological Stuff, and Philosophy.

<small>Feel free to reach me out by email at vaibhavahuja@outlook.com</small>
