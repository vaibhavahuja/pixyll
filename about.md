Heyy!
I am __Vaibhav Ahuja__, a third year Electrical Engineering undergrad at Delhi Technological University (_formerly Delhi College of Engineering._). I am interested in Mathematics, Machine Learning and Data Analysis. I like to solve Algorithmic Problems, and am into web development as well. I also like experimenting with embedded stuff. 

I enjoy playing Chess<small>([play with me ](https://www.chess.com/member/ahujavaibhav))</small>, running, cricket, __football__, badminton, any physical activity tbh that challenges me. I am a huge CR7 and Real Madrid Fan and follow almost all their games. I like to read about Mythological Stuff and Fiction and History.
